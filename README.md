# Files Contained
This repository contains files that are related to our PCA training. There are two files in this rep: 
1. pca_gsp, which is a sample data (in both .csv and .dta) adapted from Ani Katchova's PCA training (2014) that we will be using in our training
2. PCA Do-file, which is a Stata do-file containing the commands related to the PCA implementation of the sample dataset
3. pca.txt, which is a log file containing the Stata PCA session output
