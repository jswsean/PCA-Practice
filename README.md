# PCA-Practice
This repository is intended to store PCA training (2 June 2021) related files

This repository contains files that are related to our PCA training. There are two files in this rep: 
1. pca_gsp, which is a sample data adapted from Ani Katchova's PCA training (2014) that we will be using in our training
2. PCA Do-file, which is a Stata do-file containing the commands related to the PCA implementation of the sample dataset
3. pca.txt, which is a log file containing the Stata PCA session output
